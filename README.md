**parametrics** is the rewriting of an old nodebox/python script, used to create pseudo-random artistic shapes from bezier curves, made in 2008.

While stumbling upon old archives, the **parametrics** project popped back and this repository is a rewriting, using a [Mersenne Twister](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) to extract params from a seed, stored in `location.hash`.
